b)Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
c)The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

2:
e)Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
